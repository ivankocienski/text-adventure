  %DESCRIBE
    A dark and miserable place, not fit for mortals, or those who cling to their
    mortality. Beware the darkest corners, for you never know what may pop up.

%ROOM hall
  
  %DESCRIBE
    Large and open, high vaulted ceilings. But a chill air blows through
    this place. Some say it is the souls of the uncounted dead, bought to 
    the shores of the afterlife by the artful performances of the resident
    torturer.
